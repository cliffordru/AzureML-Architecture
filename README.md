# Azure ML Project Architecture Demo

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to architecting AI/ML solutions using Microsoft Azure, showcasing best practices in:

1. Platform Architecture
2. Model Development
3. MLOps & Deployment
4. Integration & Monitoring

## Project Overview

This demo project implements a simple classification model using Azure Machine Learning service, demonstrating the full ML lifecycle including:

- Data preparation and versioning
- Model training and experimentation
- Model deployment and serving
- Monitoring and maintenance

## Architecture Components

### 1. Development Environment
- Azure Machine Learning Workspace
- Azure ML Compute Clusters
- Azure ML Datastores

### 2. MLOps Pipeline
- Azure DevOps for CI/CD
- Azure ML Pipelines for automation
- Model Registry for versioning

### 3. Production Environment
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for model serving
- Azure Monitor for observability
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management
